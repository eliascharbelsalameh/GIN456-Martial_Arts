## Brief Description

Pepper, our Martial Arts Instructor, teaches basic fighting stances, assesses skill levels, and educates on martial arts history.
She complements the coach, offering personalized attention to students when the coach is busy.

Coaches need help managing students of different skill levels.
Pepper assists with basic lessons, allowing coaches to focus on advanced students while fostering discipline and growth.

Pepper the sensei teaches the students the stances by displaying videos to the students.

A more optimal and advanced method of performing this act is to take a picture of the completed stance, process the joints' positions, and give feedback so that the student can level up and move forward based on Pepper the sensei's decisions.

### Disclaimer:
These scripts work individually but they have not been integrated within this project completely. Though the architecture is fully developed to support a future enhancement of the project.
